BACKGROUND: Artificial-intelligence algorithms derive rules and patterns from
large amounts of data to calculate the probabilities of various outcomes using
new sets of similar data. In medicine, artificial intelligence (AI) has been
applied primarily to image-recognition diagnostic tasks and evaluating the
probabilities of particular outcomes after treatment. However, the performance
and limitations of AI in the automated detection and classification of fractures 
has not been examined comprehensively.
QUESTION/PURPOSES: In this systematic review, we asked (1) What is the proportion
of correctly detected or classified fractures and the area under the receiving
operating characteristic (AUC) curve of AI fracture detection and classification 
models? (2) What is the performance of AI in this setting compared with the
performance of human examiners?
METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched 
from the start of each respective database until September 6, 2018, using terms
related to "fracture", "artificial intelligence", and "detection, prediction, or 
evaluation." Of 1221 identified studies, we retained 10 studies: eight studies
involved fracture detection (ankle, hand, hip, spine, wrist, and ulna), one
addressed fracture classification (diaphyseal femur), and one addressed both
fracture detection and classification (proximal humerus). We registered the
review before data collection (PROSPERO: CRD42018110167) and used the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). We reported
the range of the accuracy and AUC for the performance of the predicted fracture
detection and/or classification task. An AUC of 1.0 would indicate perfect
prediction, whereas 0.5 would indicate a prediction is no better than a
flip-of-a-coin. We conducted quality assessment using a seven-item checklist
based on a modified methodologic index for nonrandomized studies instrument
(MINORS).
RESULTS: For fracture detection, the AUC in five studies reflected near perfect
prediction (range, 0.95-1.0) , and the accuracy in seven studies ranged from 83% 
to 98%. For fracture classification, the AUC was 0.94 in one study, and the
accuracy in two studies ranged from 77% to 90%. In two studies AI outperformed
human examiners for detecting and classifying hip and proximal humerus fractures,
and one study showed equivalent performance for detecting wrist, hand and ankle
fractures.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary experience with fracture detection and classification
using AI shows promising performance. AI may enhance processing and communicating
probabilistic tasks in medicine, including orthopaedic surgery. At present,
inadequate reference standard assignments to train and test AI is the biggest
hurdle before integration into clinical workflow. The next step will be to apply 
AI to more challenging diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios when there is absence
of certitude. Future studies should also seek to address legal regulation and
better determine feasibility of implementation in clinical practice.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, diagnostic study.

Background: Adequate field triage of trauma patients is crucial to transport
patients to the right hospital. Mistriage and subsequent interhospital transfers 
should be minimized to reduce avoidable mortality, life-long disabilities, and
costs. Availability of a prehospital triage tool may help to identify patients in
need of specialized trauma care and to determine the optimal transportation
destination.
Methods: The GOAT (Gradient Boosted Trauma Triage) study is a prospective,
multi-site, cross-sectional diagnostic study. Patients transported by at least
five ground Emergency Medical Services to any receiving hospital within the
Netherlands are eligible for inclusion. The reference standards for the need of
specialized trauma care are an Injury Severity Score ≥ 16 and early critical
resource use, which will both be assessed by trauma registrars after the final
diagnosis is made. Variable selection will be based on ease of use in practice
and clinical expertise. A gradient boosting decision tree algorithm will be used 
to develop the prediction model. Model accuracy will be assessed in terms of
discrimination (c-statistic) and calibration (intercept, slope, and plot) on
individual participant's data from each participating cluster (i.e., Emergency
Medical Service) through internal-external cross-validation. A reference model
will be externally validated on each cluster as well. The resulting model
statistics will be investigated, compared, and summarized through an individual
participant's data meta-analysis.
Discussion: The GOAT study protocol describes the development of a new prediction
model for identifying patients in need of specialized trauma care. The aim is to 
attain acceptable undertriage rates and to minimize mortality rates and life-long
disabilities.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2017 Jun 6;166(11):.

Description: This guideline updates the 2008 American College of Physicians (ACP)
recommendations on treatment of low bone density and osteoporosis to prevent
fractures in men and women. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of
Family Physicians.
Methods: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a
systematic review of randomized controlled trials; systematic reviews; large
observational studies (for adverse events); and case reports (for rare events)
that were published between 2 January 2005 and 3 June 2011. The review was
updated to July 2016 by using a machine-learning method, and a limited update to 
October 2016 was done. Clinical outcomes evaluated were fractures and adverse
events. This guideline focuses on the comparative benefits and risks of short-
and long-term pharmacologic treatments for low bone density, including
pharmaceutical prescriptions, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was
graded according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
and Evaluation) system.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audience for this guideline
includes all clinicians. The target patient population includes men and women
with low bone density and osteoporosis.
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians offer pharmacologic treatment
with alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, or denosumab to reduce the risk
for hip and vertebral fractures in women who have known osteoporosis. (Grade:
strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians treat osteoporotic women with
pharmacologic therapy for 5 years. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality
evidence).
Recommendation 3: ACP recommends that clinicians offer pharmacologic treatment
with bisphosphonates to reduce the risk for vertebral fracture in men who have
clinically recognized osteoporosis. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality
evidence).
Recommendation 4: ACP recommends against bone density monitoring during the
5-year pharmacologic treatment period for osteoporosis in women. (Grade: weak
recommendation; low-quality evidence).
Recommendation 5: ACP recommends against using menopausal estrogen therapy or
menopausal estrogen plus progestogen therapy or raloxifene for the treatment of
osteoporosis in women. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).
Recommendation 6: ACP recommends that clinicians should make the decision whether
to treat osteopenic women 65 years of age or older who are at a high risk for
fracture based on a discussion of patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and
benefits, harms, and costs of medications. (Grade: weak recommendation;
low-quality evidence).

Machine learning and new vital signs monitoring in civilian en route care: A
systematic review of the literature and future implications for the military.

Antonio, Texas.

BACKGROUND: Although air transport medical services are today an integral part of
trauma systems in most developed countries, to date, there are no reviews on
recent innovations in civilian en route care. The purpose of this systematic
review was to identify potential machine learning and new vital signs monitoring 
technologies in civilian en route care that could help close civilian and
military capability gaps in monitoring and the early detection and treatment of
various trauma injuries.
METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and citation
review of relevant primary and review articles were searched for studies
involving civilian en route care, air medical transport, and technologies from
January 2005 to November 2015. Data were abstracted on study design, population, 
year, sponsors, innovation category, details of technologies, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Thirteen observational studies involving civilian medical transport met 
inclusion criteria. Studies either focused on machine learning and software
algorithms (n = 5), new vital signs monitoring (n = 6), or both (n = 2).
Innovations involved continuous digital acquisition of physiologic data and
parameter extraction. Importantly, all studies (n = 13) demonstrated improved
outcomes where applicable and potential use during civilian and military en route
care. However, almost all studies required further validation in prospective
and/or randomized controlled trials.
CONCLUSION: Potential machine learning technologies and monitoring of novel vital
signs such as heart rate variability and complexity in civilian en route care
could help enhance en route care for our nation's war fighters. In a complex
global environment, they could potentially fill capability gaps such as
monitoring and the early detection and treatment of various trauma injuries.
However, the impact of these innovations and technologies will require further
validation before widespread acceptance and prehospital use.

Brain cancer and neurological injuries, such as stroke, are life-threatening
conditions for which further research is needed to overcome the many challenges
associated with providing optimal patient care. Multivariate analysis (MVA) is a 
class of pattern recognition technique involving the processing of data that
contains multiple measurements per sample. MVA can be used to address a wide
variety of neuroimaging challenges, including identifying variables associated
with patient outcomes; understanding an injury's etiology, development, and
progression; creating diagnostic tests; assisting in treatment monitoring; and
more. Compared to adults, imaging of the developing brain has attracted less
attention from MVA researchers, however, remarkable MVA growth has occurred in
recent years. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of the
literature focusing on MVA technologies applied to brain injury and cancer in
neurological fetal, neonatal, and pediatric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
With a wide variety of MRI modalities providing physiologically meaningful
biomarkers and new biomarker measurements constantly under development, MVA
techniques hold enormous potential toward combining available measurements toward
improving basic research and the creation of technologies that contribute to
improving patient care.

Psychology and Counselling, Faculty of Health, Queensland University of
Technology, Kelvin Grove 4059, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Electronic
address: k.vallmuur@qut.edu.au.

OBJECTIVE: To synthesise recent research on the use of machine learning
approaches to mining textual injury surveillance data.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: The electronic databases which were searched included PubMed,
Cinahl, Medline, Google Scholar, and Proquest. The bibliography of all relevant
articles was examined and associated articles were identified using a snowballing
technique.
SELECTION CRITERIA: For inclusion, articles were required to meet the following
criteria: (a) used a health-related database, (b) focused on injury-related
cases, AND used machine learning approaches to analyse textual data.
METHODS: The papers identified through the search were screened resulting in 16
papers selected for review. Articles were reviewed to describe the databases and 
methodology used, the strength and limitations of different techniques, and
quality assurance approaches used. Due to heterogeneity between studies
meta-analysis was not performed.
RESULTS: Occupational injuries were the focus of half of the machine learning
studies and the most common methods described were Bayesian probability or
Bayesian network based methods to either predict injury categories or extract
common injury scenarios. Models were evaluated through either comparison with
gold standard data or content expert evaluation or statistical measures of
quality. Machine learning was found to provide high precision and accuracy when
predicting a small number of categories, was valuable for visualisation of injury
patterns and prediction of future outcomes. However, difficulties related to
generalizability, source data quality, complexity of models and integration of
content and technical knowledge were discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of narrative text for injury surveillance has grown in
popularity, complexity and quality over recent years. With advances in data
mining techniques, increased capacity for analysis of large databases, and
involvement of computer scientists in the injury prevention field, along with
more comprehensive use and description of quality assurance methods in text
mining approaches, it is likely that we will see a continued growth and
advancement in knowledge of text mining in the injury field.
